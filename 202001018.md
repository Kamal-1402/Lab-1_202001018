        Q.1  Identify FRs and NFRs: Library Information System (LIS)

    
1] Functional Requirements :

    •  Member registration and Login: 
        => Any user who wants to access the library's resources must first register with the library information system.
        => Only Member will able to login in order to issue or return the book while user can only browse the books.

    •  Search/Filter book(For all Users): 
        => The user shall be able to search either all of the initial set of databases containing books or select a subset from it. 
        => Any user should be able to filter books from searched result by Authors, Publisher, even suggested tags/topics ...

    •  Issue book(Members Only): 
        => Any member of LIS can issue a book against his account provided that:
        => No other member has currently issued the book than member can issue book. 

    •  Pre-booking/Re-isuue (Memeber Only):
        => Member can reserve date for particular book if currently not available.

    •  Extend date for issued book:
        => The system also enables a member to extend the date of his borrowing if no other booking for that particular book has been made.
  
    •  Return book(Members Only): 
        => That is, a book once issued should be returned within the next 20 days by the corresponding member of LIS. 

    •  Add/Remove book Record(Librarian Only):
        => Librarian can enter a new record into the system when a new book has been purchased.
        => Librarian can remove a record in case any book is taken off the shelf.
        
    •  Remove Member(Library Staff):
        => Library staff can remove member for breaking rules etc.


2] Non-Functional Requirements:

    •  Security Requirements: 
        => No password should be stored directly as plaint  text but excyptions must be done before storing into databse.

    •  accessible: 
        => This system should be accessible only within the institute LAN.
        => This system should accessible 24x7 time. 
    
    •  Scalible:
        => System should be scalable so even more students try to access at the same time it should work.

    •  compatiblity Constraints: 
        => The LIS must be created as a web application that is compatible with all recent browser versions. 
        => The system should be developed using HTML 5
    
    • Performance:
        => All task should be completed whithin small amount of time.


        Q.2. Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following problem.




    • Scope:
        => App focus to help audience having heaving hearing disabilities.
        => So overall it should target to 5% ( 466 million people) people around the world.

    • Features:
        => App should should use Artificial intelligence to recognize the around sound such as horns, animal sounds etc. 
        => App should able to alert the user at fraction of time using vibration. 
        => App should continously working and anlayse event sound and use different vibration to discretize the events.

    • Non-functional aspects:
        => The predictions of the Mobile Application should be very accurate latency
        => App should compatible with most android version.
        => Scalability shoule be there as we app have millions of user try to engage at the time.
        => Security should be there to ensure aclnowledge that user have reacted to sound.
        => Less Power/memoryt Consumption to ensure android device don't stuck.
